## What is BetterTA?

BetterTeachAssist, often referred to as BetterTA, is an essential app for YRDSB that provides a modern, user-friendly interface for
accessing TeachAssist, YRDSB's official student grade portal. BetterTA is built using React Native and Expo on the front end, and
a combination of Supabase and custom backend services on the back end.

### How does BetterTA work?

BetterTA works by using our own scraper to fetch and parse raw HTML data from TeachAssist's website, and then displaying it in a
user-friendly interface. Furthermore, our app offers an optional data sharing mode that allows users to anonymously share their
data with us, which we use to provide helpful analytics to users.

### Features

- Modern, user-friendly interface
- Optional data sharing mode
- Course-by-course and school-by-school analytics
- Integration with YRAA to show sports rankings and games
- Grade prediction
- Class chatrooms
- iOS and Android support
- Native widgets
