## What is Ralph?

Ralph is a small and autonomous robot car that leverages computer vision and machine learning to assist
people with visual impairments in navigating their environment. Ralph achieves this by using a combination
of object identification, depth estimation, and path planning to determine a safe path for the robot to follow,
in turn guiding its user.

### AI Pipeline

Ralph's AI pipeline is designed to be simple and efficient, using a combination of object identification, depth
estimation, and path planning to determine a safe path for the robot to follow. The pipeline is as follows:

1. Divide view into 5 columns
2. Detect objects in each column
3. Estimate the distance between the robot and the object
4. Assess the risks that each object poses to the robot
5. Attempt to find an open path for the robot to follow
6. Navigate the robot to the path

### Features

- Object identification
- Depth estimation
- Path planning
- Autonomous navigation
- Risk assessment
- Emergency braking
